# Sprint HL-07: Trade Executor Service Implementation

**Sprint ID**: HL-07  
**Component**: Trade Executor Service  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Started**: 2025-07-15  

## 🎯 Sprint Objective

Implement the Trade Executor Service to consume hedge trade decisions from Kafka and execute actual trades on the Bybit exchange. This is the most critical missing component as the system currently generates hedge orders but cannot execute them.

## 📋 Context and Rationale

### Why This Sprint is Critical

The HedgeLock system currently:
- ✅ Collects account data from Bybit
- ✅ Calculates risk states and LTV ratios
- ✅ Generates hedge trade decisions
- ❌ **CANNOT execute the trades** (this is what we're fixing)

Without the Trade Executor, HedgeLock is like a car without an engine - all the systems are in place, but it cannot perform its core function of actually hedging positions.

### Technical Context

The Trade Executor will:
1. Consume messages from the `hedge_trades` Kafka topic
2. Transform hedge decisions into Bybit API order format
3. Execute orders via Bybit REST API
4. Track order status and confirm execution
5. Publish execution results for audit/monitoring

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### Service Structure
```
src/hedgelock/trade_executor/
├── __init__.py
├── api.py              # FastAPI app with health/metrics endpoints
├── config.py           # Environment configuration
├── kafka_config.py     # Kafka consumer setup
├── models.py           # Pydantic models for trades
├── service.py          # Core trade execution logic
├── bybit_client.py     # Bybit API wrapper for orders
└── utils.py            # Helper functions
```

### Data Flow
```
hedge_trades topic → Trade Executor → Bybit API
                           ↓
                    trade_confirmations topic
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Idempotency**: Use unique trade IDs to prevent duplicate orders
2. **Rate Limiting**: Respect Bybit API limits (10 orders/second)
3. **Error Handling**: Implement exponential backoff for retries
4. **Order Types**: Start with market orders for immediate execution
5. **Position Tracking**: Maintain local state of executed trades

## 📝 Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create Sprint Documentation (HL-07-1) ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Rationale**: Document the plan before implementation to ensure clarity and alignment.

### Task 2: Design Trade Executor Architecture (HL-07-2) ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Defined service interfaces and models in `models.py`
- ✅ Designed Kafka message schemas (TradeExecution, TradeConfirmation)
- ✅ Planned Bybit API integration approach with rate limiting
- ✅ Documented error handling strategy with retry logic

**Implementation Details**:
- Created comprehensive data models for trade execution lifecycle
- Designed ExecutionStatus enum to track order states
- Added ExecutionError model for structured error handling
- Created TradeConfirmation message for the confirmations topic
- Implemented configuration structure with safety limits

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Idempotency**: Using order_link_id as client order ID
2. **Rate Limiting**: Configured 10 orders/second limit
3. **Safety Limits**: Max 1 BTC per order, 10 BTC daily volume
4. **Retry Logic**: 3 retries with exponential backoff

**Rationale**: Clear architecture prevents rework and ensures all edge cases are considered.

### Task 3: Implement Kafka Consumer (HL-07-3) ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Implementation Steps**:
1. ✅ Created kafka_config.py with consumer setup
2. ✅ Subscribed to `hedge_trades` topic
3. ✅ Implemented message deserialization
4. ✅ Added consumer group management
5. ✅ Included health checks for consumer status

**Implementation Details**:
- Created KafkaManager class for managing connections
- Implemented async consumer with proper error handling
- Added trace_id extraction from message headers
- Configured consumer group with proper timeouts

**Rationale**: Following the integration-first approach, we ensure the service can receive messages before implementing business logic.

### Task 4: Implement Bybit Order Execution (HL-07-4) ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create bybit_client.py with authenticated client
2. Implement place_order() method
3. Add order type mapping (hedge → market order)
4. Include position size validation
5. Handle API responses and errors

**Rationale**: Core functionality - transforms hedge decisions into actual trades.

### Task 5: Add Order Status Tracking (HL-07-5) ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Implementation Steps**:
1. Implement order status polling
2. Create trade confirmation models
3. Publish confirmations to Kafka topic
4. Add database persistence (optional)
5. Include execution metrics

**Rationale**: Critical for audit trail and ensuring trades are actually executed.

### Task 6: Implement Error Handling (HL-07-6) ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Error Scenarios**:
1. Bybit API unavailable
2. Insufficient balance
3. Invalid order parameters
4. Rate limit exceeded
5. Network timeouts

**Rationale**: Production systems must handle failures gracefully without losing trade decisions.

### Task 7: Create Integration Tests (HL-07-7) ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Test Coverage**:
1. End-to-end trade execution flow
2. Error handling scenarios
3. Idempotency verification
4. Performance testing (<150ms)
5. Soak test (5+ minutes)

**Rationale**: Critical component requires comprehensive testing before handling real money.

### Task 8: Update Documentation (HL-07-8) ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Updates Required**:
- ✅ COMPONENT_MAP.yaml - Added Trade Executor with INTEGRATED status
- ✅ PROJECT_MEMORY.yaml - Updated current status and achievements
- ✅ API documentation - Included in api.py with OpenAPI specs
- ✅ README.md - Updated with v1.1.0 and Trade Executor details

**Rationale**: Keep project documentation synchronized with implementation.

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

- Update documentation

## 📊 Success Criteria

1. **Functional Requirements**:

   - Executes orders on Bybit within 150ms
   - Publishes confirmations to Kafka
   - Handles all error scenarios

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - 99.9% uptime (auto-recovery)

   - Zero duplicate orders
   - 80%+ test coverage

3. **Integration Requirements**:

   - Exposes Prometheus metrics
   - Includes comprehensive logging

## 🔍 Technical Considerations

### Security
- API credentials in environment variables
- Never log sensitive order details
- Implement request signing correctly
- Add order size limits

### Performance
- Async/await for all I/O operations
- Connection pooling for Bybit API
- Batch processing where possible
- Circuit breaker pattern for API failures

### Monitoring
