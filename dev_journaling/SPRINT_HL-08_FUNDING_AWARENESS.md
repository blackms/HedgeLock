# Sprint HL-08: Funding Awareness Implementation

**Sprint ID**: HL-08  
**Component**: Funding Rate Monitoring & Integration  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Started**: 2025-07-15  

## 🎯 Sprint Objective

Implement funding rate awareness as the core decision driver for HedgeLock, enabling the system to monitor funding rates, detect funding regimes, and adjust position sizing based on funding costs. This is critical for achieving the original vision of a funding-aware volatility harvesting framework.

## 📋 Context and Rationale

### Why This Sprint is Critical

Based on the original project requirements, HedgeLock was designed to be a **funding-aware framework** where:
- Funding rates are the PRIMARY decision driver
- Position sizing scales with funding costs
- System switches strategies based on funding regimes
- Profits come from funding rate inefficiencies

Currently, the system has ZERO funding awareness, making this the most critical gap.

### Technical Context

The funding rate system will:
1. Collect funding rates from Bybit every 8 hours
2. Calculate annualized funding costs
3. Detect funding regimes (NEUTRAL → NORMAL → HEATED → MANIA → EXTREME)
4. Adjust position sizing based on regime
5. Trigger strategy switches at extreme levels

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### Data Flow
```
Bybit API → Collector → funding_rates topic → Funding Engine
                                                    ↓
                                            funding_regime topic
                                                    ↓
Risk Engine ← funding context ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ↓
    ↓
risk_state (with funding context) → Hedger → adjusted positions
```

### New Components

#### 1. Funding Rate Collection (Collector Enhancement)
- New endpoint: `/v5/market/funding/history`
- Collection frequency: Every hour (funding updates every 8h)
- Store last 7 days of funding history

#### 2. Funding Engine Service (New)

class FundingRegime(Enum):
    NEUTRAL = "neutral"     # < 10% APR
    NORMAL = "normal"       # 10-50% APR  
    HEATED = "heated"       # 50-100% APR
    MANIA = "mania"         # 100-300% APR
    EXTREME = "extreme"     # > 300% APR
    
class FundingContext:
    current_regime: FundingRegime
    current_rate: float
    avg_rate_24h: float
    avg_rate_7d: float
    position_multiplier: float  # 0.2 to 1.0
```

## 🔍 Technical Considerations

### Funding Rate Formulas
```python
# Annualized rate
annualized = funding_rate_8h * 3 * 365

# Position multiplier
if annualized < 10:  # NEUTRAL
    multiplier = 1.0
elif annualized < 50:  # NORMAL
    multiplier = 1.0 - (annualized - 10) / 100
elif annualized < 100:  # HEATED
    multiplier = 0.6 - (annualized - 50) / 250
elif annualized < 300:  # MANIA
    multiplier = 0.4 - (annualized - 100) / 500
else:  # EXTREME
    multiplier = 0.0  # Exit all positions
```

### API Limits
- Bybit funding history: 200 records per request
- Rate limit: 10 requests/second
- Cache funding data to minimize API calls

### Monitoring
- Funding rate metrics
- Regime distribution histogram
- Position scaling effectiveness
