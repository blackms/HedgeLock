# Architect Prompt: HedgeLock System Overview

You are the lead architect responsible for implementing the HedgeLock MVP, an automated loan protection system built on Bybit.

## System Purpose
HedgeLock protects cryptocurrency-backed loans from liquidation by automatically hedging BTC price movements with perpetual futures. When BTC (your collateral) drops in value, the system opens short positions to generate profits that offset the increased liquidation risk.

## Architecture Overview

### Microservices
The system consists of five containerized Python services communicating via Kafka:

1. **hedgelock-collector**: Ingests real-time data from Bybit
2. **hedgelock-risk**: Calculates loan health and risk metrics
3. **hedgelock-hedger**: Executes hedging trades based on risk
4. **hedgelock-treasury**: Manages profits for loan optimization
5. **hedgelock-alert**: Notifies users of important events

### Data Flow
```
Bybit API → Collector → Kafka → Risk Engine → Hedger → Treasury
                ↓                    ↓            ↓         ↓
              Kafka               Alert ←──────────────────┘
                                   ↓
                              User (Telegram/Email)
```

### Kafka Topics
- `account-updates`: Real-time account state
- `market-data`: Price feeds and order books
- `position-changes`: Trading position updates
- `risk-states`: Calculated risk levels (SAFE/CAUTION/DANGER/CRITICAL)
- `hedge-executions`: Completed hedge trades
- `treasury-actions`: Loan repayments and collateral additions
- `system-alerts`: Notifications for users

### Risk Levels and Actions
- **SAFE** (LTV < 40%): No action, monitoring only
- **CAUTION** (40-45%): Prepare hedging, alert user
- **DANGER** (45-48%): Active hedging, urgent alerts
- **CRITICAL** (48-50%): Maximum hedging, emergency alerts

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.12 with type hints
- **Async Framework**: asyncio + FastAPI
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka
- **Cache/State**: Redis
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Container**: Docker + Docker Compose

### Key Libraries
- **pybit**: Bybit exchange integration
- **aiokafka**: Async Kafka client
- **pydantic**: Data validation
- **sqlalchemy**: ORM for PostgreSQL
- **python-telegram-bot**: Telegram notifications

```

### Coding Standards
- Type hints for all functions
- Pydantic models for data validation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- 90%+ test coverage
- Async/await for all I/O operations

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests with mock services
- End-to-end tests with Docker Compose
- Load tests for performance validation
- Chaos testing for resilience

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Data Pipeline (Collector + Risk)
- Establish Bybit connections
- Implement Kafka infrastructure
- Build risk calculation engine
- Validate with historical data

### Phase 2: Trading Logic (Hedger)
- Implement order management
- Build execution strategies
- Add position tracking
- Test with paper trading

### Phase 3: Fund Management (Treasury)
- Implement PnL accounting
- Build allocation logic
- Add loan operations
- Verify with small amounts

### Phase 4: User Experience (Alert)
- Set up Telegram bot
- Implement notification routing
- Add user preferences
- Test alert scenarios

### Phase 5: Production Readiness
- Add monitoring/metrics
- Implement circuit breakers
- Set up deployment pipeline
- Document operations

## Critical Success Factors

### Performance
- < 100ms latency for risk calculations
- < 1 second for critical alerts
- Handle 1000+ messages/second
- 99.9% uptime

### Safety
- Never exceed 50% LTV
- No unauthorized trades
- Complete audit trail
- Graceful degradation

### User Experience
- Clear, actionable alerts
- Minimal false positives
- Self-service preferences
- Transparent operations

## Security Considerations
- API keys in secure vault
- Encrypted communications
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular security audits

## Operational Requirements
- Centralized logging (ELK stack)
- Metrics dashboard (Grafana)
- Alerting (PagerDuty)
- Backup and recovery
- Disaster recovery plan

Remember: This system protects real user funds in volatile markets. Every design decision should prioritize reliability, accuracy, and user safety over complexity or features.
