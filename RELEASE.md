# Release v1.0.0 - Foundation Complete

## 🎉 Overview

HedgeLock v1.0.0 marks the completion of the foundational data pipeline for automated trading risk management. This release delivers a fully integrated event-driven system that monitors trading positions in real-time and automatically generates hedge orders based on configurable risk thresholds.

## 🚀 Key Achievements

### Complete Data Pipeline
- **End-to-End Integration**: Data flows seamlessly from Bybit → Collector → Risk Engine → Hedger
- **No Integration Debt**: All components are fully wired and communicating via Kafka
- **Real-Time Processing**: Sub-150ms latency from data ingestion to hedge decision

### Production-Ready Infrastructure
- **Resilient Design**: Automatic reconnection, error recovery, and message deduplication
- **Observability**: Structured logging with trace IDs, Prometheus metrics, health checks
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized settings with environment-based overrides
- **Testing**: Integration tests, soak tests, and comprehensive unit test coverage

## 📊 System Components

### 1. Collector Service
- WebSocket streaming for real-time market data and positions
- REST API polling for collateral and loan information
- Reliable Kafka producer with exactly-once semantics
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

### 2. Risk Engine v1.0
- LTV (Loan-to-Value) calculation and monitoring
- Risk state machine: NORMAL → CAUTION → DANGER → CRITICAL
- Net delta position tracking
- Hedge recommendation generation
- Processing latency consistently under 150ms

### 3. Hedger Service v0.9
- Consumes risk state changes in real-time
- Generates appropriately sized hedge orders
- Executes trades on Bybit testnet
- Tracks order status and publishes results

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

- **Architecture**: Event-driven microservices with Apache Kafka
- **Language**: Python 3.11 with async/await throughout
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, aiokafka, Pydantic
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, structured JSON logging
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose with health checks

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Message Throughput**: 1000+ messages/second capacity
- **Processing Latency**: < 150ms (99th percentile)
- **Reliability**: Automatic recovery from connection failures
- **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable via Kafka partitions

## 🗺️ What's Next
