- No automatic deployment logic
- No reserve health monitoring

### 3. Advanced Features ‚ùå
**Document Requirement:**

- Calendar spread migration for high funding
- Options hedging when IV < 45%

**Implementation Status:** ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Single exchange support only (Bybit)
- No calendar spread logic
- No options integration

### 4. Safety Features ‚ùå
**Document Requirement:**
- Panic-close routine if Distance_to_Liq < 5% AND NetEquity drop > 10%
- Dead man's switch if bot offline > 1h
- Docker watchdog + manual kill-all hotkey

**Implementation Status:** ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Basic health checks only
- No dead man's switch
- No panic-close logic

## üìä Coverage Summary

| Category | Coverage | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Funding Awareness | 100% | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Architecture | 90% | ‚úÖ Strong |
| Monitoring | 85% | ‚úÖ Good |
| LTV Management | 40% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial |
| Trading Logic | 0% | ‚ùå Missing |
| Reserve System | 0% | ‚ùå Missing |
| Safety Features | 20% | ‚ùå Weak |

**Overall Feature Coverage: ~45%**

## üîç Key Gaps Analysis

### 1. **Core Trading Engine Missing**
The biggest gap is the actual trading logic. We have excellent infrastructure for monitoring funding rates but no implementation of:
- Delta-neutral position management
- Profit target and stop loss logic
- Position rebalancing based on volatility

### 2. **Reserve System Not Connected**
While we have a Treasury service, it's not implementing the critical reserve deployment logic that protects against liquidation.

### 3. **Risk Parameters Not Integrated**
We calculate LTV and funding regimes but don't connect them to actual position sizing and reserve deployment decisions.

## üìã Recommendations for Full Implementation

### Phase 1: Complete Core Trading (Priority: HIGH)
1. Implement delta-neutral position manager
2. Add profit target and trailing stop logic
3. Connect to loan repayment system
4. Integrate volatility-based hedge ratios

### Phase 2: Reserve Management (Priority: HIGH)
1. Implement LTVManager class
2. Add reserve deployment logic
3. Create reserve health monitoring
4. Integrate with position sizing

### Phase 3: Safety Systems (Priority: MEDIUM)
1. Implement panic-close routine
2. Add dead man's switch
3. Create manual override controls
4. Add liquidation distance monitoring

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Priority: LOW)
1. Multi-exchange support
2. Calendar spread logic
3. Options integration
4. Funding arbitrage scanner

## üéØ Conclusion

The current v1.2.0 implementation provides **excellent infrastructure** for funding awareness and monitoring but **lacks the core trading logic** described in the specification. The system is essentially a sophisticated monitoring platform that needs the actual trading engine to be complete.

To achieve 100% feature coverage, focus should be on:
1. Implementing the delta-neutral trading strategy
2. Connecting LTV management to reserve deployment
3. Adding safety features and fail-safes

The foundation is solid - what's needed now is to build the trading logic on top of this robust infrastructure.
